I am

- Programming in Javascript/TypeScript with React/Remix/Next, Node, GraphQL and other fancy tech in fashion 
- Occasionally enjoying Rust
- Configuring and reconfiguring whatever one can configure (webpack, vite, github actions, circle, razzle, give me more)
- Having fun by improving quality of life
- So lazy, that sometimes I spend the whole day writing a script to automate things
- Writing Node.js servers with PostgreSQL purely for enjoyment, fullstack is underpaid
- Exploring WebGL with Three.js, Rapier, GLSL (this hard)
- Never finishing games on Unity, your wallet is safe

Real capture of me at work:

                            /  \

                         --:'''':--
                           :'_' :
                           _:"":\___
            ' '      ____.' :::     '._

                            .'     \\
                           :       :
                          /   :    \
                         :   .      '.

- [THREE.JS + Cannon] A helicopter controller with physics [Repo](https://github.com/oslavdev/helicopter-with-physics) | [Live Demo](https://helicopter-with-physics.vercel.app/) (works, but no game mechanics yet)

- [THREE.JS] A third person controller with modern camera. [Repo](https://github.com/oslavdev/webgl-third-person-controller) | [Live Demo](https://webgl-third-person-controller.vercel.app/) | [Article](https://oslavdev.medium.com/third-person-controller-in-three-js-b643bec50f92) (kinda works, no physics though)

- [THREE.JS] A simple spinning galaxy made with particle sytem with a mesmorizing piano nocurne by Chopin. [Repo](https://github.com/oslavdev/flying-through-space) | [Live Demo](https://flying-through-space.vercel.app/) (just fooling around)
