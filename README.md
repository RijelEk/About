I am

- Programming with React/Remix/Next, Node, Javascript/TypeScript, GraphQL and other fancy tech in fashion 
- Occasionally enjoying Rust
- Configuring and reconfiguring whatever you can configure (webpack, github actions, circle, razzle, give me more)
- Writing Node.js servers with PostgreSQL purely for enjoyment, fullstack is underpaid
- Exploring WebGL with Three.js, Rapier, GLSL and hope one day to build something meaningful with it
- Never finishing games on Unity, your wallet is safe
